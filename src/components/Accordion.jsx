								Tokenizing the debt is crucial because it enables multiple users
								to share the associated risks and rewards. It helps distribute
								not only the potential losses but also the profits among users,
								thus reducing the impact of a single champion's failure to repay
								their debt while also providing opportunities for users to
								benefit from successful champions. Additionally, tokenizing the
								debt means that users own the asset and have the option to sell
								it if they want or need to.

								If a champion is unable to repay the debt in full, they may
								postpone the payment. However, doing so will incur additional
								interest. It's important to note that postponement has a time
								limit, and the DAO must eventually make a decision on how to
								proceed if a portion of the debt still remains unpaid.
